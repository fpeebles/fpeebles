# Francisco Peebles

**Builder | Security | Systems | AI**

Co-founder of **SF Foundry** and a hands-on builder across security, systems, and human-AI collaboration.

**Now:** Designing a local, privacy-first research assistant stack and multi-AI collaboration workflows, plus shipping **HamTab** improvements with Steven.

## Quick Facts

- **Role:** Director, Cybersecurity (logging & monitoring); co-founder @ **SF Foundry**
- **Focus:** Secure systems, local AI assistants, agentic workflows, robust infrastructure
- **Location:** Texas (DFW)
- **Contact:** Open to selective collaboration — reach via GitHub or LinkedIn

## What I'm Building

- **Oberon / Tron** — privacy-first home AI system (local-first, multi-agent)
- **HamTab** — amateur radio dashboard (mapping, propagation, satellite tracking, space weather)
- **AICoordination** — practical inter-AI coordination protocols (roles, handoffs, safety)
- **Code Library** — small utilities, scripts, and repeatable patterns

> *Org separation:* Personal work lives under **fpeebles**. Joint work with Steven is under **[sffoundry](https://github.com/sffoundry)**. HamTab v1 originated in **[stevencheist](https://github.com/stevencheist/HamTabv1)**.

## Principles

- **Local-first privacy.** Sensitive data stays offline by default.
- **Operational clarity.** Exact paths, clear acceptance criteria, edge cases covered.
- **Resilience.** Simpler stacks beat clever stacks in production.
- **Family loyalty.** Tech should serve people, not the other way around.
