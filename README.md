## Principles

- **Local-first privacy.** Sensitive data stays offline by default.
- **Operational clarity.** Exact paths, clear acceptance criteria, edge cases covered.
- **Resilience.** Simpler stacks beat clever stacks in production.
- **Family loyalty.** Tech should serve people, not the other way around.
